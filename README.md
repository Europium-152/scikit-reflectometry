Welcome to the **Open Reflectometry Project**!


Generating energy from [nuclear fusion reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion) is crucial for the future of humankind!
These reactions occur in a plasma contained inside a [machine using complex magnetic fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_confinement_fusion).
We are able to understand the structure, the position, and the behaviour of the plasma using electromagnetic waves and a technique called *[reflectometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflectometry)*.
However, processing the raw reflectometry data is complicated and it may take months for a researcher to make sense of it.

The **Open Reflectometry Project** aims to make it **easy to access and handle reflectometry data** by providing an open source Python library and several examples of raw data that you are free to use!

Getting Started
===============

Installation
----

First of all you should install our scikit-reflectometry package.
You can do this using pip

```
pip install scikit-reflectometry
```

or directly from the source code

```
git clone https://github.com/OpenReflectometry/scikit-reflectometry.git
cd scikit-reflectometry
python python setup.py install
```


Contributing
============

We're a team of physicists and engineers working towards making nuclear fusion a reality and we need your help!

If you are interested and want to help us with code, raw data, or an idea for an example or tutorial, please read our [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) guides.
